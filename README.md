**Purpose:**  
Manages customer-related operations, including creating, updating, and deleting customer records, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Customer Creation:** Add new customer entries with unique identifiers.
- **Customer Updates:** Modify existing customer information, such as contact details.
- **Customer Deletion:** Safely remove customer records from the system.
- **Data Validation:** Ensure all customer data adheres to predefined formats and constraints.

### data.py

**Purpose:**  
Focuses on data manipulation and transformation, processing raw data to ensure it is clean, validated, and ready for use within the application.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Data Parsing:** Read and interpret data from various file formats, such as CSV and JSON.
- **Data Cleaning:** Identify and rectify inconsistencies or errors in the data.
- **Data Transformation:** Convert data into the required structures for further processing.
- **Schema Validation:** Ensure data conforms to the application's schema requirements.

### hub.py

**Purpose:**  
Serves as the central orchestrator, integrating functionalities from `customers.py` and `data.py`. It manages the overall workflow and user interactions within the application.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Module Integration:** Coordinate operations between different modules.
- **User Interaction:** Handle command-line inputs or other user interfaces.
- **Workflow Management:** Oversee the sequence of operations, ensuring smooth data flow.
- **Error Handling:** Manage exceptions and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - `hub.py` initiates the process by loading raw data through `data.py`.

2. **Data Processing:**  
   - `data.py` cleanses and transforms the data, ensuring it meets the application's requirements.

3. **Customer Management:**  
   - `hub.py` utilizes `customers.py` to perform operations like adding or updating customer records based on the processed data.

4. **Output Generation:**  
   - Results are compiled and, if necessary, exported for reporting or further analysis.
